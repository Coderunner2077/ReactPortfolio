  bio1: Hi, I'm Guillaume Coderunner, a React / NodeJS full-stack developer. I love working with web technologies and exploring the JavaScript ecosystem.

  bio3: I like both frontend and backend sides of the development. Being a self-taught programmer, I've come a long way learning different languages, including C, JAVA, PHP, and finally React/NodeJS ecosystem in which I've been swimming these last few years. Currently I'm doing React and NodeJS projects for my clients.
